This is my journal of the design and building process of **windNumber: Numpad for 60% users**.  
You can view this journal in more detail on **Hack Club Blueprint** [here](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/projects/37).


## 10/3/2025 8 AM - Started the project and   

# Decision making and name scheme
- I started by deciding the layout of this number pad. I already knew the name I was going to use as I use the same scheme for all my keyswitch related work.
- I decided to have a simple numpad layout you would find on a full sized keyboard just with an extra row on the top.

# KiCad setup
- after getting flash banged by kicad I installed a different color theme.
- I will use choc switches as I have never use those before.
- hot swap sockets are a must for me on every keyboard I make

(kicad crashed and saved nothing)
- I will also use SOD123 diodes which are tiny but they're manageable.
- I will use the rp2040 zero for its small form factor (I might change if I can't put it under a switch.)

(kicad crashed again - 08:29)

## 10/3/2025 5 PM - Routing the PCB  

I used my normal method of placing the mcu under the top left switch, therefore that switch HAS to be soldered in, whilst the others will be hot swappable. I am contemplating on putting Leds as if this will be a numpad, I don't really think there is a need for rgb...

Had to change the placement of the diodes as I ended up with a bunch of errors...
Clearance issues caused the errors, but got them cleaned up real quick and now have a fully routed PCB. I would rate my PCB as pretty well routed, unlike some of my other ones. 

## To-do list
1. Decide on LEDs
2. Make a bussing silkscreen
3. A nice 3D printed case
4. Make a README and a BOM

## 10/6/2025 - Added LEDs and silk screen.  

I added leds to the schematic, but I haven't added the leds to the pcb as I am extremely tired and cannot be bothered to route the VERY annoying SK6812MINIE leds. I also added a silkscreen to both sides with the name, and edited the diode footprint to show the orientation of the diode.

I also added the 3d models to my board making it look like this.

I might add the SK6812MINI-e's if I have time and the willpower to do so.
